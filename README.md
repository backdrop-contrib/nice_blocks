# nice_blocks

Experimental Project

This is a sandbox project, which contains experimental code for developer use only.

It aims to validate the concept of supply fieldable entities to blocks.

Originally based on @docwilmot's port of nice_menus, (hence the name !), it was refactored and completed with parts of [PR #1246](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/pull/1246).
